# The main summury text

1. Short summary of the functionality you have tested.
We have written unit tests for most of our functionallity, mainly testing the api endpoint, seeing that they return the expected values, we tried also seening in wrong data to check it returns false positive. 

2. Short summary of how you conducted your tests.

We wrote tests, and used the npm script "test", at first we created an overide compose file that executed the tests when the docker containers started. But this was not as effiecent so we instead wrote npm test from host, this by making another package.json in the root. 

3. Printout from your most recent test session so that you can see
- How many tests you have written
- What is being tested
- How many tests that pass and how many fail.
We wrote our tests in mocha with chai, tried some sinon. We wrote tests for 3 functions with two test each, one with a correct input and one with a incorrect.
When running the test this is the following output
```
burger@1.0.0 test
mocha ./Containers/BurgerOrderer/test/test.js

Connected to MenuStore
app running on http://localhost:3000/


  Testing the BurgerOrderer /order endpoint...
    ✔ Trying correct input-format
    ✔ Trying incorrect input-format.

  Trying the orderPage() function...
    ✔ Trying correct input.
    ✔ Trying incorrect input.

  Trying the getOrder() function
    ✔ Trying correct input.
    ✔ Trying incorrect input.


  6 passing (31ms)
```
All tests pass which means the functions/endpoints work as expected. 

4. Your experiences of writing automted unit tests.
- What went well?
- What did not go well?
- How did you solve your challenges? What could you have done dif-
ferently?
- What did you not manage to solve? Why not? 

Writing the tests went relativly smoothly because we sat down and did it together and did all of it together as a group. Finding information about chai syntax was a bit difficult, but once we familiarised ourselves with it, it became fairly easy. 
What we should have done was write the tests before we started implmenting our functionallity, this would have made it easier to test as well as this type development process being popular in the industry. But since we are new to software development, we had issues forseeing all the functions and how they would work. For the next project this should be implement sooner to save time when testing. We could have made more abstract tests, and refactored the function into smaller parts so we have more functionallity to test and making it easier to debug if something went wrong.
