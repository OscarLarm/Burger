### Bra saker att komma ihåg medans man skriver ###
Det här är er Ingenjörsdagbok 
Vilka git-kommandon använder ni? Vad gör de? 
Vilka svårigheter stöter ni på? Hur löser ni dem? 
Finns det något som ni inte vet hur man gör? Hur kan ni ta reda på det? 

### Dagboken ###
### 2024-09-05 ###
We familiarized ourselves with using Git as well as github and figured out how to both upload and download parts and the project.
[Link to our projekt](https://github.com/oscar-larm/Burger).
this is were we did the <MAIN> Branche.

- We created SSH Keys. We managed to solve it by reading through githubs' official documentation for SSH Keys.
- How you generatea new SSH-key: [Generating a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

- How to att a SSH key to git-hub: [Adding a new SSH key to your Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

We encounterd some Problems With Push / Pull because we were all in the same bransh at the same time trying to add to it.
To solve this issue we created a <Developer> branch from there to make "feature" branches.

### 2024-09-06 ###

I created and commited file Reflcsion and Summarizing 3.3-4.3-5.4. they are text files we can use to write our summary of the project in. Reflect on what we could have done differently and better.

### 2024-09-07 ###
We sat down and made a base list of what should be on the menu want products to be "sold" that will be subject to change but atealst we have a list that we can take from. 

We walked through the team and made sure that everyone knew how to commit push/pull files from github.
- Oscar created a bransh to start with the data base, and there for made the first ''feature bransh''

- Moltas created a ''feature bransh'' to make a HTML side with CSS

### 2024-09-16 ###
We have now commited the HTML website and some commits about the docker and data bas tho its now cmpletly finnished. I wanted to learn how to make a HTML,CSS with JS to make an interaktive Kitchenview website for eventuall use for later 

I started to look online for how to make a html site and used this link to help me get a understanding of it [HTML](https://www.hostinger.in/tutorials/making-website-with-html)

### Things i have lear how to do:
- I Learned how to create a simple website with HTML and the basic of a HTML frame work <Kitchenview.html>
- Then i complimented that with a CSS file to make it look better <Kitchenview.css>
- Also went over how to how to make a js script in a seperate file toget informasion from a static json file. <test_index.js>
- How to make buttons and reaktive links in my .js file so when i click something happens so i also had to make seperate files 
<informasion.html> and <informasion.css>

### 2024-09-17 ###
i created a bransh that i can commit to and try to make things work.
A local branch called Kitchenciew that i plan to marge with development.


### 2024-09-18 ### 

I took some notes on todays lecture 

then later continued with my personal little projekt on how to make my website and i had to download the extension <Open in browser> in vscode to be able to open it as a server.


### 2024-09-19 ###
I stared the day with doing git pull in the reminal in hopes that an issue we had yeaterday was gonna be solved becuse i had a problm getting a folder down from the git-hub server. We had a map that was names <MenuStore> and one that was named <menuSore> and for sme reason i only got one of the folders i changed name of one of the folders do to that i did not get both the folders to my computer my thinking is that git-hub for some reason reads it as the same forlder and only sends me one of them. So  i changed the name of one of then and this resoled the issue and also makes it easier to differentiate them aswell.
I puit the filed is respective folders so its easier to find and navigate for the rest of the groupp but also for the future me.

i also got extension <live server>

### 2024-09-25 ###
we all sat down today and tried to push everything we have done indeviduly. We are now trying to connect everything re-group and looking at that the next step in development will be, if we have followed the general time line our plan was to do this te 26th but we had timetoday and it saves time becuse we all feelt like we were pretty done with our projekts.

its all suppoed to work before 1 october.
so now we need to decide who needs to do what in the upcoming week

### 2024-10-05 ###
we meet today again after a few days to see were everyone is at i implimented my docker file in to the program to make sure it works while 2 of the others tried to get a overview of the projekt and make sure that everything works as planned.

We have everythin gup and running at this point of the projekt everything works as planned 

now we only need to do the rearengeing the files to make a better structure of the file system so its not as confusing and esier to navigate.

### 2024-10-06 ### 
Today i fixed the file system with help of 2 others in the groupp and made sure that it was easier to navigate and put some unused files to a specific map so we still have them if needed but they dont clutter and confuse the projekt itself.

today we are gonna spend time to document all the files and make a descripsion on how to start the projekt from a docker compose file.

we noticed that Gabe's commits was under another name tho to some local problems he had so Gabriel- and Gabe-Hog is the same user.

i changed the 3.3/4.3/5.3 to an md and made the structure of it so its esier for us all to sit down later and write the text and hopefully it goes faster.
