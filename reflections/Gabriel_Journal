5/9 What we started with was deciding our git terminal (github) following with konfigurerating it and connecting our computers to the github server by creating our unique ssh keys. This was something we had a bit of struggles with but by looking at github's documentation on how to do it, the problem solved itself. Following that we aquinted ourselves with some typical git commands in our respective terminals. Such as git add, commit, pull, push, branch and checkout. add, commit is used to save our work on git, while pull and push is taking files from github respectivly sending new updated work. Branch checks what current branch we are on and checkout creates a new branch. As we were working we where pulling and pushing from the main branch all at the same time which resulted in problems, therefore quickly decided to create a developement branch from the main one and from it create of branches that we merge with the developement one later. What i believe to be a difficult aspect of this exercise is getting an understanding on all the tools and then putting them together. But I belive that little by little it will come together. 
6/9 Started looking into some of the tools that we will be using for the assignment. I mainly started with docker as its something I have no experience or understanding of what it is and how it works (containers in general but since we decided to use docker I looked into it more). After grasping a bit on how it works I downloaded docker to my terminal and created an image and ran a container from a tutorial on dockers website, including the test exercises that were provided ( I'd say it went alright).
10/9 Our group had another meeting to go through the "Get started points" and start planning. We created our "amazing" menu that we will provide for our humble customer. Created a bit of a mind map, diagram with lucidchart so we could visualise the different aspects of the program and how we think the relate to each other. There after decide what part each one of us want/should look into more, of course we all want and need an understanding in all the areas of the assignment. But its good to split the workload between us. Personally I wanted to continue looking into docker and container systems to start with.
